# Proxy-and-Reflect

In JavaScript, the terms "proxy" and "reflect" refer to features introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) that provide a way to intercept and customize operations on objects. They are part of the metaprogramming capabilities in JavaScript, allowing developers to create powerful abstractions and implement advanced behavior for objects.

**1). Proxy:**

A Proxy object is used to define custom behavior for fundamental operations (e.g., property access, assignment, invocation) on another object.

The syntax for creating a Proxy is as follows:

const target = {}; // The object to be proxied
const handler = {
  get: function(target, prop, receiver) {
    console.log(`Getting property: ${prop}`);
    return Reflect.get(target, prop, receiver);
  },
  set: function(target, prop, value, receiver) {
    console.log(`Setting property: ${prop} to ${value}`);
    return Reflect.set(target, prop, value, receiver);
  }
};

const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);

proxy.foo = 'bar'; // Setting property: foo to bar
console.log(proxy.foo); // Getting property: foo, then prints: bar

*In this example, the handler object contains methods like get and set that intercept corresponding operations on the target object.

**2). Reflect:**

i) The Reflect object provides a set of methods that correspond to various operations performed on objects, and these methods mirror the behavior of the fundamental operations.

ii) It is often used in conjunction with Proxy to delegate operations back to the target object after some custom behavior has been applied.

**Example:**

const target = {};
const handler = {
  get: function(target, prop, receiver) {
    console.log(`Getting property: ${prop}`);
    return Reflect.get(target, prop, receiver);
  }
};

const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);

proxy.foo = 'bar';
console.log(proxy.foo); // Getting property: foo, then prints: bar

iii) In this example, the Reflect.get method is used to retrieve the value of a property, and it is called inside the get method of the handler object.

Both Proxy and Reflect are powerful tools for creating more flexible and customizable object behavior. They are often used together to implement advanced patterns such as object validation, logging, and more.
